# Welcome to typeorm-backend-basic

This is a basic banking web application that integrates: 
- React
- React-native
- Typescript
- RTK Query
- JSON Server

This is a front end application that is used to explore RTK Query in its basic form. It uses a `json-server` back end in order to mock a basic backend with all the necessary CRUD opperations while allowing a focus on the front end tools that I am practicing.
The focus was on connecting the front end React displays to the back end's REST api using RTK Query.

This application can be run by navigating to the root of the project running `npm start` to get the React project going.
A second terminal will be needed to navigate to the `server` folder and running `npm run start` in order to get the `json-server` to run.
